# Introduction to the GEVolImport module
This module is used to load 32-bit float data specifically from GE scanners, such as the General Electric v|tome|x L300 nano/microCT scanner using the proprietary .pcr file.

##Upload appropriate .pcr file
**Files needed:**
1. .pcr file associated with the specific scan
2. .vol file containing the 32-bit float data for the scan

**Upload the data**
Click the "Generate NHDR file" button. This may take a moment.

**Slice data should now be viewable, although it can be difficult to find appropriate volume rendering settings for 3D viewing.**
